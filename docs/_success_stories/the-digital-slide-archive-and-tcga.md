## The Story

The Cancer Digital Slide Archive is a website that hosts whole-slide images of pathologic specimens associated with the TCGA studies. At over 10,000 images and 20 Terabytes, the CDSA has enabled a number of the TCGA Analysis Working Group Studies, as well as other investigator-driven studies that utilize the digital pathology images (see references).

The Digital Slide Archive project builds on the success of our experience with the Cancer Digital Slide Archive, creating a software platform that allows users to create their own digital pathology servers to support data management and hosting for their own investigations.
